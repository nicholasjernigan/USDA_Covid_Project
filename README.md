# USDA_Covid_Project
Code used in contracted project by the USDA to predict what schools responses were to the pandemic with regard to their school lunch programs. 

This code takes in a folder of txt files that were web scraped from the schools websites, and a training data file, and exports an output csv of all of the predicted outcomes for each txt file in the folder. This code is what was used to make the final output for the USDA, and so the machine learning methods were chosen specifically to get the most accurate output.
