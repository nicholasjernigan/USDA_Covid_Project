April 2:It has been a busy time providing food assistance for families impacted by the COVID-19 Coronavirus threat. Thanks to our church partners and a network of volunteers, that assistance continued through Spring Break and will be ongoing through the new e-learning platform.Starting Tuesday, April 7, Madison City Schools CNP workers will be preparing   food for delivery into neighborhoods via school buses. Deliveries will be on Tuesday and Thursday, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on most routes. Residents are advised to start looking for the buses around 11 and then look generally to that time for delivery each Tuesday and Thursday going forward.In addition to the Tuesday and Thursday bus route deliveries, Discovery Middle will serve as a pickup site every Tuesday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.CNP workers for Madison City Schools will prepare seven packaged breakfasts, seven  packaged lunches and seven snacks for each student to cover each day of the week. Pickup is on Tuesdays only, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Discovery Middle Schools, 1304 Hughes Road in Madison.Madison City Schools appreciates the assistance of churches for family food distributions.

Chromebook/portable WiFi pickup is Thursday, March 26th, Asbury Church in Madison. Details here: Device Pickup  Food distribution locations and times are as follows: Food Pickup Locations  This is such a period of uncertainty. Currently, we are scheduled to come back to school Monday, April 6, after Spring Break. I cannot say at this point whether we will be cleared to reopen by then. State Schools Superintendent Dr. Eric Mackey has created a task force looking into that and many other scenarios. I will share that guidance when I get it. Here is the public information page on COVID-19 from the Alabama State Department of Education: ALSDE  I want to thank you all for the incredible outpouring of support these past few days.  We had overwhelming donations of food, household supplies and other items to give to families in need. PTAs worked side by side with school staff to make the school closing as seamless as possible. Volunteers and churches stepped in with food assistance, aided by local restaurant offers of free meals.  Our employees continue to work so that students can be fed, buildings cleaned, bills processed, technology and communications continue, and campuses remain secure.  Principals and teachers remain connected with students to ease their anxieties and ensure their well-being. This unprecedented phenomenon has brought out the best in people.  As we have seen, this health threat knows no boundaries. It is a worldwide occurrence affecting people from all walks of life.  Please follow the safeguards recommended by the experts. Take care of yourselves and your family. Let peace rule over panic. Faith over fear. We will get through this stronger as we all continue to pull together.   Mr. Eric Terrell  Interim Superintendent  Madison City Schools|
Summer Feeding Program
Unfortunately, Madison City Schools does not qualify for a Summer Feeding program, but our neighboring school system, Huntsville City Schools, does provide feeding throughout the Huntsville/Madison area.
Last year, Huntsville City Schools provided breakfast and lunch to all kids under the age of 18 at multiple sites throughout the Huntsville area. 
WHNT covered the story last May: Here
For more information, Huntsville City Schools calendar page will display the summer schedule for Summer 2020 closer to the conclusion of the spring semester.

|April 2, 2020Everyone, The school closure order by the governor finally gave us some direction in this period of uncertainty.  We now know traditional school will not resume this school year. Following the guidance of State Schools Superintendent Dr. Eric Mackey, schools will be shifting to a distance learning platform.  Madison City students will face this new paradigm shift next week under a new framework. With the state issuing this alternative school format right before the start of Spring Break, our teachers will have virtual work days on April 6-8 to make final preparations. April 9 will be the official beginning of e-learning for Madison City Schools.  We will continue using Google Classroom as our primary platform. Please note that all students will be expected to participate in e-learning. Our district has developed an Academic Guide that provides e-learning expectations for the remainder of the school year. You will be getting more information on this from your childs school soon.  We realize that these times of uncertainty bring many questions. We have prepared a COVID-19 chool Closure FAQ document. If you have questions, please click on the following link to share those with us: https://forms.gle/5BLr7ynkCDkov43XA. We will continue updating the FAQ as we receive questions.  I also want to announce one more outreach to get chromebooks and WiFi hotspots to students who need them. In an effort to protect our families and ourselves, we have now moved to a home delivery model for needed devices for required e-learning. Parents must fill out the form below to have devices delivered to their home. The previous form for device checkout is no longer valid, therefore parents must fill out this form even if they have filled out any previous form. The deadline to complete the form is Sunday, April 5. All details are here: https://bit.ly/2QP5yhV  MCS will resume its feeding program Tuesday, April 7. I want to thank our church partners and volunteers for their wonderful outreach and continued support of MCS students and families. Madison City Food Distribution Plan|

This page features foreign language translations of the Prototype Application for Free and Reduced Price School Meals. They are provided by USDA as a template to assist state and local agencies in serving households where English is not spoken as a primary language. Households may also download these resources directly to be filled out and submitted to their local school district.
In addition to the application form, each translated packet also includes application instructions, a parent letter/FAQ. We also provide a packet of communications documents to be used by State and local agencies for information sharing requests, income verification, and benefit issuance notices to households. State and local agencies responsible for administering the school meal programs may use these materials in their current form, or may adapt them as needed.
Additionally, an "I Speak" resource document is available to help identify the primary language of non-English speakers. It uses a short phrase in each of the 49 languages that an applicant can check to indicate the language they speak. "I Speak" can help Local Educational Agencies select the appropriate translation as well as ensure consistent and effective interaction with applicants who have limited English proficiency.
