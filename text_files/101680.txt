|Greene County Schools is one of 137 school districts in the state of Alabama. We are located in beautiful rural west-central Alabama between the Tombigbee and Black Warrior Rivers, and easily accessible by Interstates 59/20 and US Highways 11 & 43.We are delighted that you are visiting our website and hope that the information provided is informative and helpful. Here at the Greene County Board of Education our motto isÂ âOne Vision, One Voice, One Victory...Inspiring Every Student to SucceedâÂ where we believe that together we will accomplish great things with and for our children. Our school system has four traditional schools: Greene County High School (9 â 12), Robert Brown Middle School (4 â 8), Eutaw Primary School (K â 3) and Greene County Career Center (9 â 12). Our Alternative Learning Academy is located on the campus of Peter J Kirksey AVC. You are encouraged to visit each Â school's website for detailed specific information pertinent to programs of operation and activities.Our school system has made exceptional progress within the past few years as we focus on College and Career Readiness standards. With community support, weÂ built a new high school with gymnasium and career center. Again, welcome to our website!
