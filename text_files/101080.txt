Crisis Communication
Daleville City Schools will use the School Messenger System to notify parents and students of situations that might put the students at risk. Information about school closings due to bad weather will also be forwarded to radio and television stations in the local area. The School Messenger System requires valid phone numbers to be effective. It is important that the school have up-to-date, working phone numbers so that we may contact you about your child. Please contact your child's school if your address or phone number changes. The School Messenger System will also be used to contact parents about a child's absence or low lunch balance.
