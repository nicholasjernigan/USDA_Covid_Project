Free High Speed Internet for Students in a Difficult Time
At OTELCO, we know many students are being sent home from school during the COVID-19 pandemic and continuing their education from there.  This has created an urgent need for Internet access in homes that have previously not been able to afford a connection.  
If you don't currently have home Internet access and have a student in need, OTELCO is offering 60 days free internet access at the highest available speed on our DSL and Cable Networks in every state where we provide residential service. 
To qualify, you should not have service today and meet at least one of the following conditions:

You qualify for the National School Lunch Program; free or reduced cost lunch.
You qualify for the Community Eligibility Provision of the NSLP
You have a College Student at home and qualify for the Lifeline program.

If you meet at least one of the three requirements listed above, please complete the form below or call 1-833-OTELCO1.  You will be required to provide proof that you meet one of the eligibility requirements. 
There is no set-up fee and no monthly fee for 60 days.  OTELCO will activate DSL service on the lines feeding your home and provide a free self-installation kit to complete the installation inside your home. 
April 1, 2020 Update:
Due to overwhelming demand in our Alabama Service Area, we have reached our capacity to install additional services between now and the projected end of social distancing guidelines.  Unfortunately, this means that we are unable to accept additional applications for free service in Alabama at this time.  
We are still accepting applications in Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, Missouri, and West Virginia.
