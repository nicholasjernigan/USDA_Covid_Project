As the Superintendent, I invite you to explore our site
to learn about the numerous opportunities and 
services we provide to over 8500 students learning 
and growing in Etowah County Schools. I encourage 
you to become involved in your childs education - both inside 
and outside of the classroom. Your involvement will help 
your sons and daughters be more successful in all that they do.
Educators play a critical role of teaching knowledge 
and skills, but childrens attitudes toward school and their habits of studying, reading and learning, are largely developed at home. Our children need all of our support to reach their potential as great thinkers, innovators, and leaders. The commitment we make now will benefit  our state and country as they become citizens of the world, competing, and collaborating in an ever-changing global environment.
There are many ways to be involved with your childs education. This includes not only establishing routine homework habits, but also making time to get to know your childs teachers, administrators, and other staff members at his or her school. Ask how you can become involved in your childs educational experience.
We are dedicated to serving our students. Please join me in preparing our children to become successful citizens!
Sincerely,
Alan Cosby, Ed.D.
Superintendent
