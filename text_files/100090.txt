Page ContentThe resources below are a timeline of ALSDE communications to help understand the school's role during a closure and our commitments to Alabama's students.The best place to find accurate, up-to-date information is the State Department of Health's website. The Department of Health has also established a call center to address questions from the public about COVID-19. If you have questions about symptoms or exposure, please call 1-800-338-8374. 
In an effort to maintain ongoing communication efforts during this time when "social distancing" is critical, the Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE) has developed COVID-19 email addresses for parents and school employees.  As new developments occur, we hope this method can be used to submit your COVID-19 related questions.  ALSDE staff will be continuously monitoring submissions and will provide responses in a timely manner.  We will continue to work through this together to support "Every Child, Every Chance, Every Day".
