100120|20200528162320|wayback=True|CDC Recommends
Everyone can do their part to help us respond to this emerging public health threat by following CDC recommendations:

Wear a cloth face covering in public settings to avoid spreading COVID-19 to others in case you are infected but do not have symptoms.
The cloth face cover is meant to protect other people in case you are infected.
The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those are considered critical supplies that should be reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders, as recommended by CDC.
The cloth face covering is not a substitute for social distancing.
CDC continues to recommend that people try keep about 6 feet between themselves and others.

On April 16, the White House released Guidelines for Opening Up America Againexternal icon, a phased approach to help state and local officials reopen their economies, get people back to work, and continue to protect American lives.
People who are sick
If you get a fever or cough, consider whether you might have COVID-19, depending on where you live, your travel history, and other exposures. All of the United States is seeing some level of community spread of COVID-19. You may ask to be tested for COVID-19 by contacting a medical provider or health department, but it’s important that you know there is no treatment for this virus. Most people who get the virus have mild illness and are able to recover at home without medical care.
People at higher risk for severe illness
People 65 years and older and people with serious underlying medical conditions should take special precautions because they are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 illness.
Travelers
American citizens, lawful permanent residents, and their families who have been in one of the countries with travel restrictions for entering the United States in the past 14 days will be allowed to enter the United States but will be redirected to one of 13 airports. After you return from one of these countries, you should stay home and monitor your health.
All other international travelers, please follow CDC instructions during this time. Your cooperation is integral to the ongoing public health response to try to slow spread of this virus.
Healthcare Providers
If you are a healthcare provider, use your judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested. CDC’s Criteria to Guide Evaluation and Laboratory Testing for COVID-19 provides priorities for testing patients with suspected COVID-19 infection.
COVID-19 Background
COVID-19 is caused by a new coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus, named SARS-CoV-2.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.
Early on, many of the patients at the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Person-to-person spread was subsequently reported outside Hubei and in countries outside China, including in the United States. Most international destinations now have ongoing community spread with the virus that causes COVID-19, as does the United States. Community spread means some people have been infected and it is not known how or where they became exposed. Learn more about the spread of this coronavirus that is causing COVID-19.

eLearning Spirit Week April 6-April 10
Updated April 2, 2020

Join us for Spirit Week April 6-April 10! Be creative, have fun and reconnect with our fun Spirit Week themes!  When students return to learning on Monday, April 6, we want you to know this will be a soft opening into the eLearning experience. This will be a time of adjustment to our new learning reality, and we want to ease our teachers, students and parents into this new realm with an emphasis on reconnection. The primary focus during eLearning will be clearly established during this first week, and we can sum it up in one word: connection. As a school system, we will intentionally focus on creating connections to address the social-emotional health of our students. To this end, we invite everyone to participate in eLearning Spirit Week April 6-April 10!

Monday: Move Over Corona (show your best dance moves)
Tuesday: Until Tomorrow (share an old pic, new pic and describe your future self and your dream)
Wednesday: All is Ours Day: Wonderful World (take a pic of something in nature and explain why you love it)
Thursday: Throwback Thursday (share a favorite memory, or a memory from school this year)
Friday: Favorite Foods Day (share favorite food, recipe, or restaurant)

Share your moments, videos and images on your online class platforms and social media. Be creative, have fun and reconnect! Use the #oneathens when you share. It's great to be a Golden Eagle!
  

 Message to Parents regarding eLearning
Grace, change and connections:  Moving forward together through eLearning the “One Athens” way
Updated March 29, 2020
As we move forward with our plans to transition all of our students in grades K-12 to eLearning for the remainder of the school year, we want to share a brief overview of what the next few weeks will look like for Athens City Schools families.
SPRING BREAK   First, we want our families to enjoy Spring Break the week of March 30 - April 3. Our entire school community is experiencing stress,  anxiety and worry as a result of the current public health situation. We encourage parents, students and teachers to enjoy this time, relax as much as possible and take a deep breath before we begin our next chapter as a school community.
THE FIRST 5 DAYS - MAKING CONNECTIONS   When students return to learning on Monday, April 6, we want you to know this will be a soft opening into the eLearning experience. This will be a time of adjustment to our new learning reality, and we want to ease our teachers, students and parents into this new realm with an emphasis on reconnection. The primary focus during eLearning will be clearly established during this first week - as a school system, we will intentionally focus on creating connections and the social-emotional health of our students. 
THE REMAINDER OF THE SCHOOL YEAR - KEEP IT SIMPLE   Beginning Monday, April 13, a flexible and modified version of academic eLearning will begin for all students. We are working to make eLearning digestible and manageable for all families. Teachers will be working to keep things simple by prioritizing the most essential skills and standards for their grade level. 
A ripple of heartache moved through our school community when we all heard the news that we would not be returning to campus this year. There was no opportunity for proper “goodbyes,” and the proverbial rug seemed to be pulled from under our collective feet. However, what we have seen in the days since the announcement is a wave of emotion that extinguishes that heartache - and that wave is one of love. Love for our children, our teachers, our parents, our schools and our community. The good news is this - love wins. 
One thing is certain in Athens - our students and our people are our most important priority. At the end of this chapter, when our sense of normalcy has returned, we will be able to look back at this time and be proud that we, as a community, met this challenge with respect for our common humanity and with deep, abiding grace. Grace for our students, grace for our teachers, grace for our parents and grace for ourselves. We believe that if we put people first, imbue our work with optimism, approach our challenges with humility, remain flexible, practice patience and show grace to everyone that we will learn through this together and emerge better and brighter than ever before. 
 

Kindergarten Registration Deadline Extension
Updated March 26, 2020
Given the current circumstances due to the public health crisis brought on by COVID-19, Athens City Schools is extending the deadline for kindergarten registration and the kindergarten out-of-zone academy lottery. Parents may continue to register for kindergarten and/or out-of-zone academy placement until further notice. We will update parents with a new registration deadline as new information becomes available. The kindergarten lottery will be conducted on May 13. Register online at www.acs-k12.org/kindergarten
 

Extended State of Emergency (Online School Through End of the  School Year)
Thursday, March 26, 2020
Today Governor Kay Ivey extended the State of Emergency due to the coronavirus pandemic and announced students will not go back to a physical school for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year.

All students (grades K-12) will begin e-learning or distance learning from home beginning Monday, April 6.
Online (or distance) learning is being implemented to continue learning, graduate seniors and prevent “summer slide.”
Dr. Eric Mackey, state superintendent of schools, said they (the Alabama State Department of Education) will do all they can to make sure Alabama seniors graduate this year.
Students with special needs will maintain an IEP to continue their education and learning.
Dr. Mackey said he is extending the official end of the school year to June 5 as needed.  
All sports and band activities are canceled through June 5. 
Our hope is that special events such as graduation and prom can be rescheduled as public health circumstances improve. 

While this is difficult news for many families to take in, it is important to keep in mind that these extraordinary measures are being put in place to guard public health and protect human life. The health and safety of our students is paramount.
Our local school system will make staffing decisions and determinations related to access to school buildings in accordance with all applicable public health orders and the recommendations of the CDC and the ADPH. Athens City Schools (ACS) administrators and leaders are already working to have plans in place that will serve every student in our system. 
Dr. Holladay and his team will be working with the State Department of Education over the next several days to determine what this will look like for our students, parents, teachers and staff. As new information becomes available, we will share it with you. 
During this unprecedented time of change and adjustment, we want to remind our school community that we are in a great position to make this move to continue the learning experience for all of our students. Online eLearning is not a new concept for ACS, but rather an extension of a solid platform that we have been building over the last several years. While online learning it is not new to us, the scope is. This adjustment will require patience and a generous grace period for students, parents and teachers alike. While making the switch to eLearning for all students (K-12) will be a new experience for us as a school family, please trust that we will get through this together.
 

AHS STORM SHELTER CLOSED
UPDATED MARCH 23, 2020
The Athens High School storm shelter will NOT be open to the public during severe weather events until further notice. We look forward to providing shelter to our community once again when it is safe after the coronavirus public health crisis has passed. 

MESSAGE TO PARENTS - SCHOOL CLOSING FOR STATE OF EMERGENCY BREAK
UPDATED MARCH 18, 2020
Dear ACS Family,
We hope this letter will provide you with important information during this unprecedented time of change. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, our campuses will be closed after today until further notice with the exception of limited staff to maintain necessary operations.
Teachers will not be delivering active instruction over the next two weeks, and students are not expected to complete any school work. However, in an effort to provide resources to parents and students who are interested in working at their own pace, teachers may post optional work for students through their online classroom platforms (Canvas, Google Classroom and SeeSaw). This work is meant only to serve as a support to families who wish to use it. Teachers will be observing the Spring Break holiday between March 30-April 3. 
We have created a website that is dedicated to helping parents and students gain a better understanding of eLearning in ACS. The site includes a Frequently Asked Questions section for parents. We will answer questions and update this as often as possible. We hope you find the parent site helpful.
Visit the ACS eLearning Website at acs-k12.org/elearning.
We will continue to provide free community meal service through March 27. The Full Tummy Project will distribute food items on Wednesday, April 1, from Athens Middle School. Details will come next week. You can find the meal distribution schedule, locations and other important updates at acs-k12.org/coronavirus.
The State Superintendent's office will make a determination and recommendation on the possible extension of school closure by March 30. We will update you as information becomes available.

If during the break you have questions that are urgent and need attention, please email one of the following:

Instruction and Registration Questions:  Beth Patton at beth.patton@acs-k12.org
Finance and Operations Questions:  Serena Owsley at serena.owsley@acs-k12.org



We wish you and your family well during the break, and we strongly encourage everyone to continue to follow the Centers for Disease Control guidelines and recommendations for social distancing, good hygiene and travel. We will miss seeing our students and families. Follow us on Facebook and Twitter to stay connected. 
Kind Regards,
Athens City Schools

eLearning Spirit Week April 6-April 10
Updated April 2, 2020

Join us for Spirit Week April 6-April 10! Be creative, have fun and reconnect with our fun Spirit Week themes!  When students return to learning on Monday, April 6, we want you to know this will be a soft opening into the eLearning experience. This will be a time of adjustment to our new learning reality, and we want to ease our teachers, students and parents into this new realm with an emphasis on reconnection. The primary focus during eLearning will be clearly established during this first week, and we can sum it up in one word: connection. As a school system, we will intentionally focus on creating connections to address the social-emotional health of our students. To this end, we invite everyone to participate in eLearning Spirit Week April 6-April 10!

Monday: Move Over Corona (show your best dance moves)
Tuesday: Until Tomorrow (share an old pic, new pic and describe your future self and your dream)
Wednesday: All is Ours Day: Wonderful World (take a pic of something in nature and explain why you love it)
Thursday: Throwback Thursday (share a favorite memory, or a memory from school this year)
Friday: Favorite Foods Day (share favorite food, recipe, or restaurant)

Share your moments, videos and images on your online class platforms and social media. Be creative, have fun and reconnect! Use the #oneathens when you share. It's great to be a Golden Eagle!
  

 Message to Parents regarding eLearning
Grace, change and connections:  Moving forward together through eLearning the “One Athens” way
Updated March 29, 2020
As we move forward with our plans to transition all of our students in grades K-12 to eLearning for the remainder of the school year, we want to share a brief overview of what the next few weeks will look like for Athens City Schools families.
SPRING BREAK   First, we want our families to enjoy Spring Break the week of March 30 - April 3. Our entire school community is experiencing stress,  anxiety and worry as a result of the current public health situation. We encourage parents, students and teachers to enjoy this time, relax as much as possible and take a deep breath before we begin our next chapter as a school community.
THE FIRST 5 DAYS - MAKING CONNECTIONS   When students return to learning on Monday, April 6, we want you to know this will be a soft opening into the eLearning experience. This will be a time of adjustment to our new learning reality, and we want to ease our teachers, students and parents into this new realm with an emphasis on reconnection. The primary focus during eLearning will be clearly established during this first week - as a school system, we will intentionally focus on creating connections and the social-emotional health of our students. 
THE REMAINDER OF THE SCHOOL YEAR - KEEP IT SIMPLE   Beginning Monday, April 13, a flexible and modified version of academic eLearning will begin for all students. We are working to make eLearning digestible and manageable for all families. Teachers will be working to keep things simple by prioritizing the most essential skills and standards for their grade level. 
A ripple of heartache moved through our school community when we all heard the news that we would not be returning to campus this year. There was no opportunity for proper “goodbyes,” and the proverbial rug seemed to be pulled from under our collective feet. However, what we have seen in the days since the announcement is a wave of emotion that extinguishes that heartache - and that wave is one of love. Love for our children, our teachers, our parents, our schools and our community. The good news is this - love wins. 
One thing is certain in Athens - our students and our people are our most important priority. At the end of this chapter, when our sense of normalcy has returned, we will be able to look back at this time and be proud that we, as a community, met this challenge with respect for our common humanity and with deep, abiding grace. Grace for our students, grace for our teachers, grace for our parents and grace for ourselves. We believe that if we put people first, imbue our work with optimism, approach our challenges with humility, remain flexible, practice patience and show grace to everyone that we will learn through this together and emerge better and brighter than ever before. 
 

Kindergarten Registration Deadline Extension
Updated March 26, 2020
Given the current circumstances due to the public health crisis brought on by COVID-19, Athens City Schools is extending the deadline for kindergarten registration and the kindergarten out-of-zone academy lottery. Parents may continue to register for kindergarten and/or out-of-zone academy placement until further notice. We will update parents with a new registration deadline as new information becomes available. The kindergarten lottery will be conducted on May 13. Register online at www.acs-k12.org/kindergarten
 

Extended State of Emergency (Online School Through End of the  School Year)
Thursday, March 26, 2020
Today Governor Kay Ivey extended the State of Emergency due to the coronavirus pandemic and announced students will not go back to a physical school for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year.

All students (grades K-12) will begin e-learning or distance learning from home beginning Monday, April 6.
Online (or distance) learning is being implemented to continue learning, graduate seniors and prevent “summer slide.”
Dr. Eric Mackey, state superintendent of schools, said they (the Alabama State Department of Education) will do all they can to make sure Alabama seniors graduate this year.
Students with special needs will maintain an IEP to continue their education and learning.
Dr. Mackey said he is extending the official end of the school year to June 5 as needed.  
All sports and band activities are canceled through June 5. 
Our hope is that special events such as graduation and prom can be rescheduled as public health circumstances improve. 

While this is difficult news for many families to take in, it is important to keep in mind that these extraordinary measures are being put in place to guard public health and protect human life. The health and safety of our students is paramount.
Our local school system will make staffing decisions and determinations related to access to school buildings in accordance with all applicable public health orders and the recommendations of the CDC and the ADPH. Athens City Schools (ACS) administrators and leaders are already working to have plans in place that will serve every student in our system. 
Dr. Holladay and his team will be working with the State Department of Education over the next several days to determine what this will look like for our students, parents, teachers and staff. As new information becomes available, we will share it with you. 
During this unprecedented time of change and adjustment, we want to remind our school community that we are in a great position to make this move to continue the learning experience for all of our students. Online eLearning is not a new concept for ACS, but rather an extension of a solid platform that we have been building over the last several years. While online learning it is not new to us, the scope is. This adjustment will require patience and a generous grace period for students, parents and teachers alike. While making the switch to eLearning for all students (K-12) will be a new experience for us as a school family, please trust that we will get through this together.
 

AHS STORM SHELTER CLOSED
UPDATED MARCH 23, 2020
The Athens High School storm shelter will NOT be open to the public during severe weather events until further notice. We look forward to providing shelter to our community once again when it is safe after the coronavirus public health crisis has passed. 

MESSAGE TO PARENTS - SCHOOL CLOSING FOR STATE OF EMERGENCY BREAK
UPDATED MARCH 18, 2020
Dear ACS Family,
We hope this letter will provide you with important information during this unprecedented time of change. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, our campuses will be closed after today until further notice with the exception of limited staff to maintain necessary operations.
Teachers will not be delivering active instruction over the next two weeks, and students are not expected to complete any school work. However, in an effort to provide resources to parents and students who are interested in working at their own pace, teachers may post optional work for students through their online classroom platforms (Canvas, Google Classroom and SeeSaw). This work is meant only to serve as a support to families who wish to use it. Teachers will be observing the Spring Break holiday between March 30-April 3. 
We have created a website that is dedicated to helping parents and students gain a better understanding of eLearning in ACS. The site includes a Frequently Asked Questions section for parents. We will answer questions and update this as often as possible. We hope you find the parent site helpful.
Visit the ACS eLearning Website at acs-k12.org/elearning.
We will continue to provide free community meal service through March 27. The Full Tummy Project will distribute food items on Wednesday, April 1, from Athens Middle School. Details will come next week. You can find the meal distribution schedule, locations and other important updates at acs-k12.org/coronavirus.
The State Superintendent's office will make a determination and recommendation on the possible extension of school closure by March 30. We will update you as information becomes available.

If during the break you have questions that are urgent and need attention, please email one of the following:

Instruction and Registration Questions:  Beth Patton at beth.patton@acs-k12.org
Finance and Operations Questions:  Serena Owsley at serena.owsley@acs-k12.org



We wish you and your family well during the break, and we strongly encourage everyone to continue to follow the Centers for Disease Control guidelines and recommendations for social distancing, good hygiene and travel. We will miss seeing our students and families. Follow us on Facebook and Twitter to stay connected. 
Kind Regards,
Athens City Schools

ACS OFFERS ELEARNING OPTION FOR STUDENTS FOR MONDAY-WEDNESDAY NEXT WEEK
UPDATED MARCH 14, 2020

Athens City Schools (ACS) will be open and classes will be in session Monday, March 16 through Wednesday, March 18. During these three days, ACS will offer eLearning as an option for students and families. 
eLearning days will not count against a student’s attendance or exam exemption. eLearning days are available to any student by request. There is no need to fill out a form. 
Parents and students in grades K-8 can request eLearning days by contacting their student's homeroom teacher. Teachers will arrange the best method for receiving assignments. 
Students in grades 9-12 will find assignments in Canvas, the ACS online Learning Management System (LMS). Students should use their GMail account for all communications with Athens High School.
Teacher email addresses are available on each school’s website. Parents in grades K-5 can contact their teacher through SeeSaw as well.  
Beginning Thursday, March 19, all ACS schools will be closed under Governor Kay Ivey’s State of Emergency and per the Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE) mandate. Schools will remain closed for a minimum of 2 weeks. The ALSDE will determine a return date in the coming weeks, and families will be notified as information becomes available. Currently, the plan for ACS is to return following the scheduled Spring Break holiday.
ACS strongly encourages families and employees to follow the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommendations concerning travel. 
ACS will continue to follow the lead of the State of Alabama, Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) and the CDC.
Because this is an ever-evolving situation, ACS asks that parents monitor the district website and social media periodically for updates.

Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Person-to-person spread was subsequently reported outside Hubei and in countries outside China, including in the United States. Most international destinations now have ongoing community spread with the virus that causes COVID-19, as does the United States. Community spread means some people have been infected and it is not known how or where they became exposed. Learn more about the spread of this coronavirus that is causing COVID-19.|
