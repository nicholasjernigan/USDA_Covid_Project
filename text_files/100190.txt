Emaline Morris Scores a Perfect ACT Score
 
Emaline Sutton Morris, daughter of Zandra and James Morris and a junior at Thompson High School, earned the highest possible ACT composite score of 36. Fewer than half of one percent of students who take the ACT earn a top score. In the U.S. high school graduating class of 2019, only 4,879 out of nearly 1.8 million students who took the ACT earned a top composite score of 36. The ACT consists of tests in English, mathematics, reading and science, each scored on a scale of 1â36. A student's composite score is the average of the four test scores. The score for ACTâs optional writing test is reported separately and is not included within the ACT composite score. In a letter to the student recognizing this exceptional achievement, ACT CEO Marten Roorda stated, âYour achievement on the ACT is significant and rare. Your exceptional scores will provide any college or university with ample evidence of your readiness for the academic rigors that lie ahead.â The ACT is a curriculum-based achievement exam that measures what students have learned in school. Students who earn a 36 composite score have likely mastered all of the skills and knowledge they will need to succeed in first-year college courses in the core subject areas. ACT scores are accepted by all major four-year colleges and universities across the US.

#BeTheLight Video Premiere
 
On Thursday, April 9 at 8:20 P.M., Thompson High School and Alabaster City Schools proudly participated in the Be The Light (#BeTheLight) movement that is spreading across the nation, from state to state and school to school. We turned on all of our campus and stadium lights to show support of our 544 amazing seniors, the Class of 2020. We are sharing this video of our Be The Light efforts from last Thursday, however the video also reflects our mindset during this time of uncertainty.
