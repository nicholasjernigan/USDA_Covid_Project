April 1, 2020
To our valued Dothan City School students, parents and staff,
On March 26, 2020, as directed by Governor Kay Ivey and Alabama State Superintendent of Education, Dothan City Schools along with all K-12 public schools across the State of Alabama will close all school buildings and in-person instruction for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year. With that closure, all public schools must implement a plan to complete the 2019-2020 school year using alternate methods of instruction as established by the State Superintendent of Education. 
On April 3, 2020, Dothan City Schools submitted to the Alabama State Department of Education their 2019-2020 Academic Continuity Plan for Dothan City Schools. Dothan City Schools has selected to offer a blended method of Distance/Virtual Learning and Learning Packets.
  

  
Dothan City Schools timeline for instruction will begin on April 13 giving our teachers and staff an opportunity to instructionally plan beginning Monday, April 6 for a week.
Our goal has a system is to provide students with the opportunity to practice skills already taught during the face to face part of the 2019-2020 school year. DCS will use a blended approach to include familiar online resources and hard copy materials to include answer keys. 
During the transition into the alternate route of learning, Dothan City School teachers will be tasked with contacting every parent of every child in our district via phone call to determine home resources for online learning, personal preference for online versus hard copy resources and the ability for an adult or sibling to assist with assignments.
Each of our Dothan City Schools will organize hard copy resources to distribute to students for the remainder of the year. It is important that our parents and students continue to communicate with their school during this time. Dothan City Schools will continue to provide students continuity with opportunities to practice skills and strategies learned during this school year. Practice materials will support retention of skills and strategies while being away from the traditional classroom.
In addition to our general education teachers, we are ensuring our children are still in contact with their guidance counselors, English language teachers as well as our special education teachers. Each child where ever they are will continue to be supported by our DCS team.
Additionally, our Child Nutrition Program will continue to offer curbside meal service for lunch at our selected locations across the district. With this service, we are able to continue to provide bagged lunches and snacks for many of our children aged 18 and under. We continue to offer these meals regardless of a childs school or district. This program will continue until our last day of the school year on June 5 and will not operate on school holidays. EVERY child deserves a healthy meal as well as a great education. More information regarding the meal service can also be found on our virtual learning website.
For the remainder of the year, Dothan City Schools has established a website dedicated solely to offering resources for our families during this untimely closing. This website can be found at sites.google.com/dothan.k12.al.us/dothancityschools/home or clicking At Home on our DCS website.
We appreciate the patience and cooperation of our families and stakeholders as our leadership and educators work together to provide an instructional connection between our schools and our students.
We hope our families continue to stay safe and healthy at this time. In the coming days, please be on the lookout for communication from your schools and if you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to your schools.
 
Dr. Phyllis Edwards
Superintendent
