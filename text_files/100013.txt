TCS parents - Check out these great optional resources for you and your students!
 
There are no mandatory activities or assignments during our school closure now through April 6.  Your childâs teacher has been doing a good job sharing resources with you through email and/or Google Classroom. We would like to share a list of resources that are very familiar to your children as they already use them during their regular school day. All of these resources are FREE for your use at home. Your childâs teacher may also be in contact with you with additional resources.  As TCS Curriculum and Instruction continues to research and be made aware of valuable resources, they will be reviewed and shared with principals to share with teachers.
