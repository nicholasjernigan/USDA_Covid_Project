We love that our community loves and supports the students of Boaz City Schools! Blessings in a Backpack is one way you can ensure that all our students are provided with hunger-free weekends. Students are given bags of food each weekend that include items that they can easily prepare (canned pastas, soups, granola bars, oatmeal, fruits, etc.). It takes approximately $100 to provide for each student each year.Â 
To donate to Blessing in a Backpack, checks should be made to Blessings in a Backpack with Boaz, AL on the âforâ line. You may take the check by Boaz City Schools Central Office or one of the school offices or mailed to Boaz City Schools:
