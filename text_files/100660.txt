Chilton County Schools will begin for students on August 6th and employees on August 3rd. With the release of the Alabama State Department of Education and Alabama Department of Public Health, "Roadmap to Reopening Schools", our school system and school leaders will be developing processes and procedures to return to school in the safest way possible for students and employees.  The school system and individual schools will be working on plans to return and will have those completed as soon as possible.  All students will be given the option of returning to the school buildings or being taught online to not have to return to the schools if you have safety concerns.  Thank you for your patience and be aware that plans and school start dates are subject to change based on the continuing public health crisis.  Keep in mind that we are all in this together!
