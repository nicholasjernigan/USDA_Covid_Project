Good nutrition and learning go hand in hand.The Nutrition Services department is made up of a team of food and nutrition professionals that are dedicated to students' health, well being and their ability to learn. We support learning by promoting healthy habits for lifelong nutrition and fitness practices.
 Child Nutrition Mission Statement
The Child Nutrition Department of Birmingham City Schools shall administer operations in accordance with the local, state and federal guidelines that promote health and wellness of students. Child Nutrition shall also work with the community and other district departments to meet educational, nutritional, social and cultural needs of children while maintaining its financial integrity.
 
 COMMUNITY ELIGIBILITY PROVISION All Students to Eat Free of Charge
Thanks to the USDA Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), all students enrolled in Birmingham City Schools are eligible to receive a healthy breakfast and lunch at no charge.  Under the program, students, regardless of income status, receive one breakfast and one lunch meal at no charge.  Additional student meals, however, as well as faculty and guest meals, will be charged at the normal price, and students continue to have the option to purchase a la carte items, as well.
 
The CEP, designed to improve access to free school meals in high poverty areas  while reducing the administrative burden of collecting household applications, allows schools that predominantly serve low-income children to offer free, nutritious school meals through the national school lunch and breakfast programs.  In the absence of paper applications, eligibility for participation is determined by information from other programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Temporary Assistance Program for Need Families (TANF).   
 
Nutrition plays a major role in the healthy growth and development of students, and we want to make sure that every child has access to a healthy breakfast and lunch each day, said Michelle Sailes, Director of Child Nutrition for BCS.  When students are fed and are receiving proper nutrition, they are better able to focus in school which leads to better overall academic performance. 
 
In that regard, Birmingham City Schools is making a concerted effort to inform parents, students and the community at large of the CEP.  This is the first year of implementation of this program in Birmingham City Schools, and families and students are encouraged to take advantage of this available food resource which plays such a vital role in the overall development of students.      
 
Use My Lunch Money.com to load money to your child's account to purchase al a carte items.
 
State and federal requirements are based on the USDA Dietary Guidelines. We provide students with access to a variety of affordable and appealing foods that meet the health and nutrition needs of students.

Good nutrition and learning go hand in hand.The Nutrition Services department is made up of a team of food and nutrition professionals that are dedicated to students' health, well being and their ability to learn. We support learning by promoting healthy habits for lifelong nutrition and fitness practices.
 Child Nutrition Mission Statement
The Child Nutrition Department of Birmingham City Schools shall administer operations in accordance with the local, state and federal guidelines that promote health and wellness of students. Child Nutrition shall also work with the community and other district departments to meet educational, nutritional, social and cultural needs of children while maintaining its financial integrity.
 
 COMMUNITY ELIGIBILITY PROVISION All Students to Eat Free of Charge
Thanks to the USDA Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), all students enrolled in Birmingham City Schools are eligible to receive a healthy breakfast and lunch at no charge.  Under the program, students, regardless of income status, receive one breakfast and one lunch meal at no charge.  Additional student meals, however, as well as faculty and guest meals, will be charged at the normal price, and students continue to have the option to purchase a la carte items, as well.
 
The CEP, designed to improve access to free school meals in high poverty areas  while reducing the administrative burden of collecting household applications, allows schools that predominantly serve low-income children to offer free, nutritious school meals through the national school lunch and breakfast programs.  In the absence of paper applications, eligibility for participation is determined by information from other programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Temporary Assistance Program for Need Families (TANF).   
 
Nutrition plays a major role in the healthy growth and development of students, and we want to make sure that every child has access to a healthy breakfast and lunch each day, said Michelle Sailes, Director of Child Nutrition for BCS.  When students are fed and are receiving proper nutrition, they are better able to focus in school which leads to better overall academic performance. 
 
In that regard, Birmingham City Schools is making a concerted effort to inform parents, students and the community at large of the CEP.  This is the first year of implementation of this program in Birmingham City Schools, and families and students are encouraged to take advantage of this available food resource which plays such a vital role in the overall development of students.      
 
Use My Lunch Money.com to load money to your child's account to purchase al a carte items.
 
State and federal requirements are based on the USDA Dietary Guidelines. We provide students with access to a variety of affordable and appealing foods that meet the health and nutrition needs of students. 
Please browse our new Child Nutrition website for all kinds of great nutrition information, including many recipes for healthy foods you can cook at home with your kids! Be sure to look in our nutrition education section for great, healthy recipes your kids will love to cook at home. You will find snack recipes and recipes for whole meals, including healthy desserts!  We want to equip families with information and the means to help their kids develop lifelong healthy habits! We hope you will enjoy our new Nutrition, Fitness, and Wellness website!
